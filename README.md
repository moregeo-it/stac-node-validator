# stac-node-validator

Simple proof-of-concept to validate STAC Items, Catalogs, Collections and core extensions with node.

See the [STAC Validator Comparison](COMPARISON.md) for the features supported by this validator and the others out there.

## Versions

**Current version: 1.1.0**

| STAC Node Validator Version | Supported STAC Versions |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1.1.x                       | >= 1.0.0-rc.1           |
| 0.4.x / 1.0.x               | >= 1.0.0-beta.2 and < 1.0.0-rc.3 |
| 0.3.0                       | 1.0.0-beta.2            |
| 0.2.1                       | 1.0.0-beta.1            |

## Quick Start

1. Install a recent version of [node and npm](https://nodejs.org)
2. `npx stac-node-validator /path/to/your/file-or-folder` to temporarily install the library and validate the provided file for folder. See the chapters below for advanced usage options.

## Setup

1. Install [node and npm](https://nodejs.org) - should run with any version >= 14. Older versions may still work, but no guarantee.
2. `npm install -g stac-node-validator` to install the library permanently

## Usage

- Validate a single file: `stac-node-validator /path/to/your/file.json`
- Validate multiple files: `stac-node-validator /path/to/your/catalog.json /path/to/your/item.json`

Instead of paths to local files, you can also use HTTP(S) URLs. Other protocols such as S3 are not supported yet.

- Validate a single folder (considers all `json` files in `examples` folders): `stac-node-validator ./stac-spec`

Further options to add to the commands above:

- To validate against schemas in a local STAC folder (e.g. `dev` branch): `--schemas /path/to/stac/folder`
- To validate against a specific local schema (e.g. an external extension): `--schemaMap https://stac-extensions.github.io/foobar/v1.0.0/schema.json=./json-schema/schema.json`
- To not verify SSL/TLS certificates: `--ignoreCerts`
- Add `--verbose` to get a more detailed output
- To lint local JSON files: `--lint` (add `--verbose` to get a diff with the changes required)
- To format / pretty-print local JSON files: `--format` (Attention: this will override the source files without warning!)

**Note on API support:** Validating lists of STAC items/collections (i.e. `GET /collections` and `GET /collections/:id/items`) is partially supported.
It only checks the contained items/collections, but not the other parts of the response (e.g. `links`).

### Config file

You can also pass a config file via the `--config` option. Simply pass a file path as value.
Parameters set via CLI will override the corresponding setting in the config file.
Make sure to use the value `false` to override boolean flags that are set to `true` in the config file.

The config file uses the same option names as above.
To specify the files to be validated, add an array with paths.
The schema map is an object instead of string separated with a `=` character.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "files": [
    "/path/to/your/catalog.json",
    "/path/to/your/item.json"
  ],
  "schemas": "/path/to/stac/folder",
  "schemaMap": {
    "https://stac-extensions.github.io/foobar/v1.0.0/schema.json": "./json-schema/schema.json"
  },
  "ignoreCerts": false,
  "verbose": false,
  "lint": true,
  "format": false
}
```

You could now override some options as follows in CLI: `stac-node-validator example.json --config /path/to/config.json --lint false`

### Development

1. `git clone https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-node-validator` to clone the repo
2. `cd stac-node-validator` to switch into the new folder created by git
3. `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run the commands as above, but replace `stac-node-validator` with `node bin/cli.js`, for example `node bin/cli.js /path/to/your/file.json`

### Test

Simply run `npm test` in a working [development environment](#development).

If you want to disable tests for your fork of the repository, simply delete `.github/workflows/test.yaml`.
